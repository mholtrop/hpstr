# Alternate Analysis with Hpstr


## Introduction
This directory contains an alternate method for analyzing Hpstr produced DST ROOT files,
without the need for writing processors or Python configuration files. The inention for this pat of the code is to be only dependent on a standard release of ROOT, and not need any of the other Hpstr components which require the additional components of LCIO, and a custom ROOT.
